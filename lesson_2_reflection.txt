Lesson 2 reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init causes hidden directory .git, with metafiles describing contents of directory,
to be created. This allows me to do commits & generally use git on this folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area contains files I intend to (but have not yet) commit(ed). Repository contains
committed files; working directory is the original folder where all my files (committed,
intended, or not) are stored.
