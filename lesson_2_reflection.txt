Lesson 2 reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init causes hidden directory .git, with metafiles describing contents of directory,
to be created. This allows me to do commits & generally use git on this folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area contains files I intend to (but have not yet) commit(ed). Repository contains
committed files; working directory is the original folder where all my files (committed,
intended, or not) are stored.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By using git add on one file at a time, and by using git status to check what's in
the staging area before a commit.
