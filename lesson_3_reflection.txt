When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- remote would come in handy when collaborating with other programmers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- You might not want to show work in progress before it's ready. Keeping it in a local
repository means you can control access until you feel the time is right.
